      <p>Yesterday I saw a film titled Macbeth. Its story elements are interesting. The film’s hero, Macbeth, assassinates Duncan and ascends to the throne of Scotland. But he is dissatisfied. He finds himself in a dangerous situation. He executes those he suspects of plotting against him. Eventually, some of the lords revolted and dethroned him and killed him. The message it conveys is that excessive ambition destroys a man. The actor and actress who played Macbeth and Lady Macbeth had exceptional performances, which significantly increased the film’s impact.

      <p>Gardening is my favourite hobby. I own a small plot of land next to our house. I cultivate gardening there. Every day, I spend half an hour gardening. After returning from my morning walk, I go to my garden with a spade and a bucket of water. I prepare the soil, prune the plants, and water them. I also use insecticides and fertilisers. My heart leaps with joy when I see the plants swaying in the wind. I feel heavenly pleasure as I watch them grow day by day.

      <p>Home is the place where we return to rest after a day’s work, and where parents and children meet together and have a carefree and joyful time. Our family consists of three members—father, mother, and brother. We live in a rural area. It is free from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is especially famous for its scenic beauty. I am the most important member of the family. Everyone trusts my judgement and agrees to follow my suggestions.

      <p>The Taj Mahal is a beautiful monument built in 1631 by an Emperor named Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is situated on the banks of river Yamuna at Agra. It looks beautiful in the moonlight. The Taj Mahal is made up of white marble. In front of the monument, there is a beautiful garden known as the Charbagh. Inside the monument, there are two tombs. These tombs are of Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is considered as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Many tourists come to see this beautiful structure from different parts of the world.
